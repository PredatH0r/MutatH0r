InstaBounce

Stingray bounces players with either primary or secondary fire and tags them to be killed with the other fire mode.
<br>After 2 seconds or when a player touches the ground he becomes untagged again, so they can only be killed mid-air.
<br>Players get a green tag when they are hit with the beam. They can then be killed with a plasma ball.
<br>Players get a yellow tag then when they are hit with 2 balls. They can then be killed with a beam.
<br>In SquadAssault you can untag your team mates with the shot that would normally kill them (green: ball, yellow: beam).
